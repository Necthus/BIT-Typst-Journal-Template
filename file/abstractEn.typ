The Outline for the Construction of an Education Power (2024-2035) proposes the classified promotion of reform and development in higher education institutions, emphasizing that the differentiated development of universities should balance their own positioning and external evaluation. This article extracts two aspects from the outline and carries out an analysis.From the perspective of universities themselves, there has been a problem of blindly expanding scales and pursuing comprehensive development in the past, leading to scattered resources and blurred disciplinary characteristics. Universities should focus on advantageous disciplines, condense characteristic disciplinary directions, promote interdisciplinary integration, optimize resource allocation, and innovate talent training models.In terms of external evaluation, the traditional single evaluation system overly relies on quantitative research indicators, triggering homogeneous competition among universities and ignoring teaching and talent training quality. A diversified evaluation system needs to be combined with the positioning of universities. For example, application-oriented universities should focus on evaluating school-enterprise cooperation and employment quality, while research-oriented universities should pay attention to evaluating research innovation. Meanwhile, process evaluation, value-added evaluation, and social participation should be strengthened. In addition, diversified evaluation can correctly guide corresponding classified support.The differentiated development of universities requires them to consolidate their own advantages and coordinate with diversified external evaluation and support, so as to establish characteristics and promote the high-quality development of higher education.
